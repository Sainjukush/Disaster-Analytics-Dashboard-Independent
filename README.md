This dashboard enables users to:

- **Compare Infrastructure Damage:** See which countries suffered the most infrastructure impact from disasters.
- **Assess Population Impact Globally:** Interactive map shows affected population size per country.
- **Analyze Response Time vs. Severity:** Understand how the severity of disasters affects emergency response times.
- **Disaster Type Economic Loss:** Bar charts quantify total estimated economic loss for each disaster type (earthquake, wildfire, flood, etc.).
- **Country-wise Response Benchmarks:** Matrix table displays average response time for each disaster and country, facilitating benchmarking and resource allocation.
- **Explore Trends & Outliers:** Identify countries or disasters with unusually high/low response, damages, or losses.
